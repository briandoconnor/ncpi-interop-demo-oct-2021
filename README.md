# NCPI October 2021 Interop Demo

## About

This is a simple development environment used for a demo showing interop between
AnVIL, BioData Catalyst, and GMKF for the NIH Cloud Platforms Interoperability
effort.  

The main feature is a python script (download.py) that
takes a Gen3 token and a file UUID from the GMKF portal and then retrieves
the file from a signed URL from the AWS cloud.

This python script is also wrapped in a WDL and can be used to pull in GMKF
data into a Terra workspace for an analysis demo as part of the NCPI effort.

See below for my shared workspace where I've tested the WDL version of the downloader.

## Origins

This project environment is inspired by, and forked from, this blog post:

**🐳 Simplified guide to using Docker for local development environment**

## Dependencies

You need Docker (along with `docker-compose`) setup and running on your computer.

## Running

To run the environment that has all the dependencies installed:

- `git clone https://github.com/briandoconnor/ncpi-interop-demo.git`
- `docker-compose up --build` to build and launch a Docker environment

## Connecting

Once you have the Docker running, you can connect using:

```
# connect from your computer terminal
$> ./connect.sh

# now go to the working directory with my script
root@02d2b8fce3af:~# cd python/scripts/python_downloading_script/

```

## Python Download Script Usage

I have a basic script located in `cd python/scripts/python_downloading_script/download.py`
that does the download.  Here's an example of how to run it.

### Get Your GMKF Token

Go to the [GMKF Data Portal](https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org/dashboard) and
log in with whatever ID you want to use.  Then go to your profile and
make sure you connect with the Data Repositories (typically you'll use
your eRA Commons account to do this) and (optionally) connect to your
Cavatica account.

Once you've logged in, open up the developer tools in Chrome and look for a
`token?fence=gen3` request.  You'll need to copy the `authorization: Bearer`
token and use this with Python script in this repo to download data. I'm
not sure how long the token is good for but it seems to work for at least
24 hour.  You'll need to copy all the text after "Bearer " in this image.

### Get the File IDs

Now that you have your token, the next step is to use the
[file repository](https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org/search/file)
to find data of interest and then download a manifest.

Select what you want and then click "File Manifest" to download
a manifest that includes the File UUIDs that you'll need to use
with the downloader tool.

Here's an example manifest:

```
File ID	Latest DID	File Name	Data Type	File Format	Experiment Strategy	Participants ID	Proband	Family Id	Sample External ID	Aliquot External ID
GF_49ZVHR6H	53d7bfde-86b2-4bd9-ba4c-27c1733e3180	34be3f7d-eda9-40cf-8325-0d14cf0fbd4d.strelka.PASS.vep.vcf.gz	Annotated Somatic Mutations	vcf	WGS, WGS	PT_AW8WV14Y	Yes	--	7316-179, 7316-179	390634, 1030630
```

What you need is the `Latest DID` here for use with the download script.

### Downloading Data

Now that you have your token and one or more File UUIDs, you can then use
the download script.  Connect to the running Docker container using then connect
script and change dir to the script dir.  Then set your token as a shell
variable, and, finally, call the downloader:

```
$> ./connect.sh

root@02d2b8fce3af:~# cd python/scripts/python_downloading_script/

root@9e01a5ba0b34:~/python/scripts/python_downloading_script# export token=eyJhbGciO...

root@9e01a5ba0b34:~/python/scripts/python_downloading_script# python download.py --token $token --fileid 53d7bfde-86b2-4bd9-ba4c-27c1733e3180 --outputdir temp
getting access token
getting signed URL
getting filename from DRS server

root@9e01a5ba0b34:~/python/scripts/python_downloading_script# ls -lth temp/
total 840K
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 839K Apr  2 22:41 34be3f7d-eda9-40cf-8325-0d14cf0fbd4d.strelka.PASS.vep.vcf.gz

```

You can see the vcf file downloaded to the `temp` directory.

## Docker Image

I build the Python image on [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/briandoconnor/ncpi-interop-demo?tab=settings)
under `briandoconnor/ncpi-interop-demo:latest`.  You can get it with:

    docker pull quay.io/briandoconnor/ncpi-interop-demo:latest

## WDL

I created a simple WDL in `python/scripts/python_downloading_script/download.wdl`

You can see the image below for how I configured it in the workspace below.

## Terra Workspace

I created a private workspace to try out this process, see
[20200918 NCPI Interoperability Demo](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/broad-firecloud-dsde/20200918%20NCPI%20Interoperability%20Demo).
You need to be added to the workspace to access it, look for the `gmkf_file`
table under the data tab.

If you want to transform the manifest from the GMKF portal and load it into your
own workspace this is what you need to make the above manifest look like:

```
entity:gmkf_file_id	file_uuid	file_drs_uri	file_name	data_type	file_format	experiment_strategy	participants_id	proband	family_id	sample_external_id	aliquot_external_id
GF_49ZVHR6H	53d7bfde-86b2-4bd9-ba4c-27c1733e3180	drs://dg.F82A1A:53d7bfde-86b2-4bd9-ba4c-27c1733e3180	34be3f7d-eda9-40cf-8325-0d14cf0fbd4d.strelka.PASS.vep.vcf.gz	Annotated Somatic Mutations	vcf	WGS, WGS	PT_AW8WV14Y	Yes	--	7316-179, 7316-179	390634, 1030630

```

You can get the DRS prefix using information in [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wf4enSGOEXD5_AE-uzLoYqjIp5MnePbZ6kYTVFp1WoM/edit#heading=h.qiwlmit3m9) document.

You can then use the upload "+" icon in the data tab of Terra to upload and
create this table.  Notice I included a DRS URI... Terra doesn't understand
this right now but in the future it will.

If you look under the workflows tab you'll then see the WDL setup and you can launch it on the gmkf_files table.

## The Future

In the future we expect Terra to provide the ability to account link
with GMKF and to understand how to resolve DRS URIs pointing to data
in GMKF.  When this happens, we expect users will migrate off of running
this download tool to manually setup and download files from GMFK.

## Python Version

See the [official python images](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) on DockerHub
as well as the [releases of Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases).  I'm
using Debian Buster and Python 3 as the basis for the Python environment that gets
launched:

    python:3-buster

It's probably a good idea to use a specific version number of Python when
writing real scripts/services.
